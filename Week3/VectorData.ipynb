    "# vector data using shapely and geopandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, you have gained some experience working with basic features of python, and used cartopy and matplotlib to create a map. In each of these practicals, you have loaded different vector datasets using a module called geopandas. In this week's practical, we'll be looking at working vector data in a bit more depth, including the different geometry types available using shapely, analyses like spatial joins and summarizing based on attributes, and how to reproject vector data from one coordinate reference system to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## objectives\n",
    "-  Gain experience working with different vector data types using shapely\n",
    "-  Use geopandas to re-project vector datasets from one coordinate reference system to another\n",
    "-  Learn about and used **vectorized** operations\n",
    "-  Summarize features using the groupby method of a GeoDataFrame\n",
    "-  Learn how to perform different vector data operations using geopandas and shapely\n",
    "\n",
    "## data provided\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data\\_files folder, you should have the following:\n",
    "-  **NI_roads.shp**, a shapefile of roads in Northern Ireland\n",
    "-  **Counties.shp**, a shapefile of county outlines for Northern Ireland\n",
    "-  **NI_Wards.shp**, a shapefile of electoral wards for Northern Ireland\n",
    "\n",
    "## getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we'll be working with vector data. As a quick refresher, the three main types of vector data that we will work with are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Point**: point data represent a single point in space. For our purposes, points are either two-dimensional (x, y) or three-dimensional (x, y, z). In `shapely`, the corresponding **class** of data is a **Point**.\n",
    "-  **Line**: lines are a sequence of at least two points that are joined together. In `shapely`, the corresponding **class** of data is known as a **LineString**.\n",
    "-  **Polygon**: polygons are a sequence of at least three points that are connected to form a **ring**, as well as any additional rings that represent holes in the polygon. In `shapely`, the corresponding **class** of data is a **Polygon**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also have **Collections** of vector data, where each feature represents a collection of **Point**, **Line**, or **Polygon** objects. In `shapely`, these are represented as **MultiPoint**, **MultiLineString**, or **MultiPolygon** objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, run the following cell to import `geopandas` and `shapely`."
